### Guessing Game

A classic "Guess the Number" game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

**Features:**
- random number generation (1-100)
- input validation (ensures user enters a valid number)
- feedback on guesses ("Too small", "Too big", "You win!")
- re-prompting on invalid input

**How to Run:**

1. Navigate to the game directory:
   ```bash
   cd guessing_game
   ```
2. Run the game using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
